## detect and enable the compudata / adafruit gps cape
##
## This script needs to be symlinked from /etc/rcS.d/S14sensorgnome-gpscape.
##
## This device attaches to ttyO4 on header P9 for the serial
## interface, and to pin 15 of header P9 for the PPS signal.
##
## It does not have a serial number eeprom, so we have to
## detect it by waiting for a sentence on the port.
##
## Also, the kernel requires a device overlay to see ttyO4
## This is in file (with md5sum):
##  /lib/firmware/ttyO4_armhf.com-00A0.dtbo  966f6111c5d28b3fb1b0a37962826d02
##

## enable ttyO4 on P9 via an overlay
echo bone-ttyO4 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots

## Not sure this is needed, but allow for the device to
sleep 0.3

GPS=/dev/ttyO4

## configure the serial port; the adafruit board's firmware
## is set to talk at 9600 bps.  We set a timeout here so
## that if no cape is present, we don't hang indefinitely,
## fixing the problem with the 2014 Sept. 10 software update.

stty -F $GPS raw 9600 min 0 time 50

## wait for a GPRMC sentence and use it to set the system clock.
## This cape has a battery-backed RTC, whose date and time appear
## immediately in GPRMC sentences, but the 'status of fix' field
## is marked as 'V' (invalid), so that gpsd ignores it.
## This means GPSD won't set the system clock from the RTC,
## waiting instead for a GPS fix which might never arrive,
## if the unit has poor sky view.

## here's a sample RMC sentence:
##  $GPRMC,174226.000,A,4505.3764,N,06422.1597,W,1.93,78.67,250814,,,A*4D
##   RMC   HHMMSS     C LAT       D LON        E  F   G     DDMMYY H I J BAD
## read until we've seen 50 sentences or a total elapsed time of 10 seconds

## we do this as a pipeline to avoid losses from opening and closing $GPS
## multiple times.  Only try read 50 sentences or for up to 10 seconds.
## This will add 10 seconds to the boot time of a non-GPS-cape SG.
## FIXME: see how low we can reduce this.
